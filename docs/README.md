# Documentation Index

This directory contains the **maintained engineering documentation** for Power Design Toolkit.

The repository used to accumulate release snapshots, one-off migration notes, temporary audit reports and patch instructions in the project root. Those files were useful while a specific version was being developed, but they made it difficult to identify the current engineering contract. The documentation policy is now:

- `README.md` — product overview, quick start and current capability map.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — concise version history.
- `docs/` — current engineering architecture, model boundaries, validation, provenance, Agent integration and deployment.
- `reference_designs/` — traceable engineering cases and evidence matrices.
- `engineering_data/` — cross-workspace catalog for device/material/core data quality.
- GitHub Issues / Pull Requests / Actions / Releases — development history, CI logs and binary artifacts.
- `release_validation/` — numerical baselines that are part of regression evidence, not narrative documentation.

## Compatibility documents

A small number of historical paths are intentionally kept as short redirect files because the in-application Help/F1 system in V9.2.2 links to them. They are **not** independent sources of truth. New documentation should link directly into `docs/`.

The compatibility paths will be removed after the Help document links are migrated in a future UI change.

## Documentation rule

A document belongs in the maintained set only if it answers one of these questions:

1. What can the current product do?
2. How is a current engineering algorithm implemented?
3. What assumptions/model boundaries apply?
4. How is a current feature installed, validated or deployed?
5. What traceable evidence would prove or falsify an engineering claim?

Per-version debugging logs, temporary patches, wheel files and CI result snapshots do not belong in the source documentation tree.
